    Sequential Monte Carlo based sampling
    Parameters
    ----------
    draws: int
        The number of samples to draw from the posterior (i.e. last stage). And also the number of
        independent chains. Defaults to 1000.
    kernel: str
        Kernel method for the SMC sampler. Available option are ``metropolis`` (default) and `ABC`.
        Use `ABC` for likelihood free inference togheter with a ``pm.Simulator``.
    n_steps: int
        The number of steps of each Markov Chain. If ``tune_steps == True`` ``n_steps`` will be used
        for the first stage and for the others it will be determined automatically based on the
        acceptance rate and `p_acc_rate`, the max number of steps is ``n_steps``.
    parallel: bool
        Distribute computations across cores if the number of cores is larger than 1.
        Defaults to False.
    start: dict, or array of dict
        Starting point in parameter space. It should be a list of dict with length `chains`.
        When None (default) the starting point is sampled from the prior distribution.
    cores: int
        The number of chains to run in parallel. If ``None`` (default), it will be automatically
        set to the number of CPUs in the system.
    tune_steps: bool
        Whether to compute the number of steps automatically or not. Defaults to True
    p_acc_rate: float
        Used to compute ``n_steps`` when ``tune_steps == True``. The higher the value of
        ``p_acc_rate`` the higher the number of steps computed automatically. Defaults to 0.99.
        It should be between 0 and 1.
    threshold: float
        Determines the change of beta from stage to stage, i.e.indirectly the number of stages,
        the higher the value of `threshold` the higher the number of stages. Defaults to 0.5.
        It should be between 0 and 1.
    epsilon: float
        Standard deviation of the gaussian pseudo likelihood. Only works with `kernel = ABC`
    dist_func: str
        Distance function. The only available option is ``gaussian_kernel``
    sum_stat: str or callable
        Summary statistics. Available options are ``indentity``, ``sorted``, ``mean``, ``median``.
        If a callable is based it should return a number or a 1d numpy array.
    progressbar: bool
        Flag for displaying a progress bar. Defaults to False.
    model: Model (optional if in ``with`` context)).
    random_seed: int
        random seed
    Notes
    -----
    SMC works by moving through successive stages. At each stage the inverse temperature
    :math:`\beta` is increased a little bit (starting from 0 up to 1). When :math:`\beta` = 0
    we have the prior distribution and when :math:`\beta` =1 we have the posterior distribution.
    So in more general terms we are always computing samples from a tempered posterior that we can
    write as:
    .. math::
        p(\theta \mid y)_{\beta} = p(y \mid \theta)^{\beta} p(\theta)
    A summary of the algorithm is:
     1. Initialize :math:`\beta` at zero and stage at zero.
     2. Generate N samples :math:`S_{\beta}` from the prior (because when :math `\beta = 0` the
         tempered posterior is the prior).
     3. Increase :math:`\beta` in order to make the effective sample size equals some predefined
        value (we use :math:`Nt`, where :math:`t` is 0.5 by default).
     4. Compute a set of N importance weights W. The weights are computed as the ratio of the
        likelihoods of a sample at stage i+1 and stage i.
     5. Obtain :math:`S_{w}` by re-sampling according to W.
     6. Use W to compute the covariance for the proposal distribution.
     7. For stages other than 0 use the acceptance rate from the previous stage to estimate the
        scaling of the proposal distribution and `n_steps`.
     8. Run N Metropolis chains (each one of length `n_steps`), starting each one from a different
        sample in :math:`S_{w}`.
     9. Repeat from step 3 until :math:`\beta \ge 1`.
     10. The final result is a collection of N samples from the posterior.
